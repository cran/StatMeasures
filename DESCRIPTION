Description: Offers useful functions to perform day-to-day data manipulation 
    operations, data quality checks and post modelling statistical checks.
    One can effortlessly change class of a number of variables to factor, 
    remove duplicate observations from the data, create deciles of a 
    variable, perform data quality checks for continuous (integer or numeric), 
    categorical (factor) and date variables, and compute goodness of fit 
    measures such as auc for statistical models. The functions are consistent 
    for objects of class 'data.frame' and 'data.table', which is an enhanced 
    'data.frame' implemented in the package 'data.table'.
Depends: R (>= 3.1.3)
